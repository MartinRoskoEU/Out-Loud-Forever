# Out Loud

Out Loud is a World of Warcraft: Forever addon in development for reading quest
text aloud with configurable voices.

## Overview

Out Loud chooses an NPC's configured voice from its visual model family and
runtime gender. A Blizzard-style Talking Head shows the speaker and dialogue
while speech is generated and played.

Manual Out Loud buttons connect current quest dialogue to the NPC's voice, or
selected Quest Log descriptions to the player's voice, Talking Head, and speech.
QuestFrame narration can also start automatically when enabled in Options;
Quest Log narration remains manual. Talking Head closes when narration ends,
and the loading spinner clears when owned playback begins.

## Current Features

- Options UI with saved Male and Female voice assignments for each Voice Family.
- Generated mappings from NPC model FileDataIDs to Voice Families.
- A runtime voice resolver that combines the model family with `UnitSex(unit)`
  and returns the configured voice.
- A custom Talking Head UI with a speaker portrait, name, dialogue text, faction
  styling, opening/closing fades, a close button that stops narration, and a
  controllable loading spinner.
- A speech controller that accepts supplied text and a WoW TTS voice ID,
  supports sentence streaming and whole-text speech, and can cancel narration.
- A saved reading-mode setting used by the speech dispatcher.
- Optional automatic narration for quest offer, progress, and reward pages,
  disabled by default. Manual buttons remain available.
- A manual **Out Loud** button for quest offer, progress, and reward dialogue.
  It uses the current NPC's portrait and voice, falling back to the player when
  the NPC's voice cannot be resolved, and reads the current dialogue.
  Talking Head closes when narration finishes or stops.
  The button hides on quest greeting/list screens and when the quest window closes.
- A manual **Out Loud** button opposite **Back** in selected Quest Log details.
  It reads the description using the player's portrait, name, and configured
  voice. Gameplay objectives are excluded.

## How Voice Selection Works

The resolver reads two independent properties of the NPC:

```text
NPC visual model -> Model FileDataID -> Voice Family
NPC UnitSex      -> Male / Female
```

It combines the family and gender to choose the player's configured voice.
Gender comes from the live NPC, rather than the model mapping.

If QuestFrame cannot resolve a usable NPC voice, the player reads the same quest
text using their configured race and gender voice.

Quest Log narration uses the player's race and runtime gender to select from the
same Voice Family assignments. Unmapped races and unset voices produce an error
instead of selecting a fallback voice.

Multiple model IDs can share one Voice Family and the same voice configuration.
For example, the two Skyborne model IDs in the Forever mapping both use
`SKYBORNE`, with separate Male and Female voice choices.

## Voice Configuration

The Out Loud Options page provides one row with separate Male and Female voice
selectors for every available Voice Family. Selectors list the TTS voices
available to the game and include a **Not set** option.

Available families come from generated mapping data. Each unique family appears
once, regardless of how many models use it. Assignments are saved between sessions.

## Speech Modes

The **Narration** section of Options offers two reading modes:

- **Split text:** reads sentence by sentence, submitting the first sentence
  immediately and prefetching one sentence ahead as playback begins.
- **Read full text** (default): sends the complete text to TTS in one request.

Talking Head displays the full dialogue in full mode and the currently spoken
sentence in split mode. Sentence changes use a brief text-only fade.
Overflowing text scrolls gently once playback begins and has a scrollbar for
manual reading. Scrolling manually pauses automatic movement for that text.

Both Out Loud quest buttons use this choice. Clicking again restarts narration
through the speech controller.

Enable **Automatically read quest text** in the same section to start narration
when quest details, progress, or reward pages open. It defaults to off and does
not apply to Quest Log. **Automatic narration delay** waits 2 seconds by default,
adjustable from 0 to 5 seconds in 0.5-second steps. The delay control is available
when automatic narration is enabled. Manual narration always starts immediately.

## Project Status

The mappings, saved voice configuration, voice resolver, Talking Head UI, TTS
controller, manual QuestFrame and Quest Log narration, and optional automatic
QuestFrame narration are implemented.
The dialogue text APIs and NPC voice resolver have been verified in-game by the
user. The combined button, Talking Head, and speech flow still requires
verification in WoW: Forever.

## Architecture

The addon separates voice resolution, speech, and presentation:

- Generated Voice Family mappings connect NPC visual models to configurable families.
- `VoiceSelection` resolves an NPC model or player race to a family, then uses
  `UnitSex` gender detection to select a configured voice.
- The TTS controller speaks supplied text with a supplied voice and applies the
  selected speech mode.
- Talking Head provides the speaker portrait, dialogue display, and loading state.
- Quest integrations supply live dialogue with the NPC as speaker, or a selected
  quest description with the player as speaker. A shared narration controller
  coordinates Talking Head with the TTS lifecycle.

## Development

Implementation details, testing commands, and in-game diagnostic helpers are
documented in [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).
