# Development Guide

Implementation reference, testing commands, and in-game diagnostic helpers for
[Out Loud](../README.md). See the main README for capabilities and project status.

## Runtime modules and initialization

Runtime services use singleton tables in the `OutLoud` namespace. `OutLoud.toc`
loads generated data, Core services, UI components, and initialization in order.
On addon load, initialization prepares the database, Options, Talking Head UI,
and QuestFrame/Quest Log integrations. `Core/Narration.lua` shares presentation
ownership and TTS callbacks between the two UI entry points.
The speech event frame is created on the first valid speech request.

## Voice data, resolution, and saved settings

- `OutLoudDB.voices[family][sex]` stores voice assignments. Families are stable
  string identities, rather than numeric DB2 RaceIDs. Runtime `UnitSex` values
  are `2` for Male and `3` for Female.
- `Data/VoiceMappings.lua` contains `VoiceMappings.Families` and direct
  `VoiceMappings.Models[FileDataID]` family mappings. It can be replaced with
  generator output and contains no gender data or addon runtime helpers.
- Options derives its rows from unique `VoiceMappings.Families` values, including
  families without model entries. Display labels convert keys such as `NIGHT_ELF`
  into readable names such as "Night Elf".
- `OutLoud.VoiceSelection:Resolve(unit, model)` accepts a PlayerModel already
  loaded for that unit and returns the configured voice ID plus inspection
  details. Unknown models, unavailable models/units, unknown sex, and unset voices
  return no voice, with a reason in the details. The resolver does not start speech.
- `OutLoud.VoiceSelection:ResolvePlayer()` uses the locale-stable token from
  `UnitRace("player")`, checks its explicit mapping against `VoiceMappings.Families`,
  and combines that family with `UnitSex("player")` and the existing database.
  It requires no inspection model. Unknown race tokens, unknown sex, and unset
  voices return no voice, with a reason; there is no fallback for custom races.
- The original eight-race numeric settings are copied once to family keys without
  overwriting existing family assignments. Numeric entries remain as backups;
  `voiceSettingsVersion = 2` prevents restoring voices the user later clears.

## Speech controller API

Callers supply text and an already-resolved voice ID to the `OutLoud.TTS` singleton:

- `SpeakStreaming(text, voiceID)` normalizes whitespace and uses the tested
  `.`, `!`, `?` sentence splitter. The first sentence is submitted immediately;
  each valid sentence ownership bookmark submits only the next sentence. Duplicate bookmarks
  cannot queue a sentence twice. No timers or artificial delays are used.
- `SpeakWholeText(text, voiceID)` submits the complete text unchanged in one
  request, preceded by one ownership bookmark. It never splits or prefetches.
- `Speak(text, voiceID)` reads the existing saved `readingMode` through the
  database: `"split"` selects streaming and `"full"` selects whole text. The
  default is `"full"`.
- `Stop()` cancels active Out Loud speech. Calling it while idle leaves other
  TTS alone.

The controller's existing event frame also handles `PLAYER_LOGOUT`, including
UI teardown for `/reload`, by calling `Stop()` before the Lua state is discarded.
This cancels the active session and stops native playback. The shutdown event and
actual audio interruption still require verification in WoW: Forever.

All three Speak methods accept an optional third argument, `onSessionEnded`.
The controller calls `onSessionEnded(reason, sessionID)` when that session ends:
`"finished"` after the final owned utterance, `"cancelled"` on stop/replacement,
or `"failed"` on a native call error or owned playback failure. Callback errors
are caught and diagnosed. Invalid input creates no session and invokes no callback.

An optional fourth argument, `onPlaybackStarted`, receives the session ID once,
at the first valid ownership bookmark for the current session. Duplicate and
later bookmarks do not notify again. Submission return and unowned playback-start
events do not invoke this callback. Callback errors are caught silently.

An optional fifth argument, `onTextProgress(text, chunk, offset, sessionID)`,
receives the full original text in full mode (`chunk = 0`), or the normalized
active sentence and its index in split mode. An ownership bookmark sends offset
0 once per active text. Callback errors are caught and printed in red.
Speech payloads always retain the existing ownership-only format, including when
the display callback is supplied.
`TTS:SplitSentences(text)` exposes the same splitter used by streaming, so Talking
Head can prepare exactly the first sentence before its entrance animation.

Word-level `OUTLOUD:PROGRESS` bookmarks were removed after the user reported
degraded speech quality. The controller adds only the original ownership bookmark
at the start of the complete text or streamed sentence. It ignores the removed
UI markers. Full mode still makes one native request, and streaming still
prefetches one sentence ahead. A display callback cannot alter the generation text.

Speak methods return `true` when submission succeeds, or `false` plus a reason:
`invalid-text`, `invalid-voice`, `no-sentences`, or `speech-failed`. A supplied
voice ID must be a nonnegative integer; `0` is valid. Rate is `0`, volume is
`100`, and overlap is `false`. Initialization creates the event frame once and
disables Blizzard's line-separator sound once.

## Sessions, cancellation, and known limitations

Both modes share cancellation and monotonically increasing session IDs. Starting
valid new speech cancels the active session before submitting immediately.
Completed/cancelled session tables are discarded; bookmark session IDs recognize
late stale audio without keeping a session history. Stale Out Loud audio triggers
`StopSpeakingText()`. Because this API stops global playback, that emergency stop
also cancels any newer Out Loud session instead of leaving it marked active.

Only owned utterances can finish or fail a session. Native call errors are caught
and printed in red regardless of the diagnostic flag. Bookmarks establish ownership. An
asynchronous failure before the first ownership bookmark cannot be distinguished
from unrelated TTS and does not change session state;
use `Stop()` if a request fails before identification. Speech methods do not
extract quest text, resolve voices, or control Talking Head behavior.

## Development testing

Run the mocked checks from the addon root with standalone Lua 5.1:

```text
lua Tests/VoiceSelection.lua
lua Tests/TTS.lua
lua Tests/QuestIntegration.lua
```

Voice-selection tests exercise the generated mappings, real Options controls,
SavedVariables migration, and addon load order. Speech tests mock the native
engine and playback events to check streaming, mode dispatch, cancellation,
stale/duplicate bookmarks, completion, failures, and input validation. Model
loading, rendering, and actual audio still require in-game checks.

Quest-integration tests exercise the real UI module and voice resolver with mocked
frames, units, model loading, Talking Head presentation, and the native speech
engine. They cover visibility and transitions, exact state-specific text passed
to Talking Head and TTS, call ordering, repeated clicks, deferred UI loading,
unresolved inputs, and failed speech submission. Additional checks use the real
TTS dispatcher to verify saved reading modes and session replacement. The mocks
do not prove Forever's actual event ordering, UI rendering, or model readiness.

## Quest narration

`OutLoud.UI.QuestIntegration` creates one unnamed `UIPanelButtonTemplate` button
parented to `QuestFrame` and one reusable inspection `PlayerModel`. The model uses
`CreateFrame("PlayerModel")` without a parent or explicit `Hide()`, matching the
user's working in-game inspection script. The button
is 100 by 22, labelled **Out Loud**, and anchored with
`SetPoint("BOTTOM", QuestFrame, "BOTTOM", -15, 38)`. This puts it in a separate
row below the Vanilla export's native action buttons at bottom offsets 72/73.
Blizzard controls are not moved or resized; placement still needs a client check.

`UpdateButtonVisibility()` centralizes visibility. It requires an open
`QuestFrame`, exactly one shown dialogue panel, a usable text API, and nonempty
dialogue. A shown `QuestFrameGreetingPanel` always hides the button, including
transitions where an older panel may still be shown. No panel or ambiguous panels
also hide it. Each click re-reads the panel and text instead of caching event state.

| Shown panel | Dialogue source |
| --- | --- |
| `QuestFrameDetailPanel` | `GetQuestText()` |
| `QuestFrameProgressPanel` | `GetProgressText()` |
| `QuestFrameRewardPanel` | `GetRewardText()` |
| `QuestFrameGreetingPanel` | None; button hidden |

Initialization adds `HookScript` callbacks after Blizzard's handlers:

- `QuestFrame`: `OnEvent`, `OnShow`, and `OnHide`.
- All four panels above: `OnShow` and `OnHide`.

The `OnEvent` hook refreshes after the frame's existing registered events, including
`QUEST_GREETING`, `QUEST_DETAIL`, `QUEST_PROGRESS`, `QUEST_COMPLETE`,
`QUEST_FINISHED`, and item/text refreshes. The module does not register quest events
on a second frame or maintain a separate quest state machine. If required frame
globals are absent, one temporary observer retries initialization on
`ADDON_LOADED`; it unregisters and releases its callback after setup succeeds.
Initialization and show/hide hooks never start speech. The single `OnEvent`
hook can also request narration for the three opt-in events described below.

On click, the module obtains current dialogue and tries the NPC first. When
`questnpc` and the inspection model are available, it clears the previous model,
calls `SetUnit("questnpc")`, then calls
`OutLoud.VoiceSelection:Resolve("questnpc", model)`. A nonnegative integer voice
ID, including `0`, keeps the NPC as speaker. Missing NPC/model, unresolved model
or family, unsupported gender, and missing or invalid configured voice instead
fall back once to the existing `VoiceSelection:ResolvePlayer()` used by Quest Log.
The chosen speaker and unchanged dialogue enter the same presentation lifecycle:

```lua
local ok, reason = OutLoud.Narration:Speak(speakerUnit, text, voiceID)
```

The existing Talking Head singleton is under `OutLoud.UI.TalkingHead`, not a
separate `OutLoud.TalkingHead`. Show receives the current dialogue and prepares
the complete text or first normalized sentence according to the saved reading mode.
The TTS dispatcher applies the existing reading mode and owns cancellation/restart;
quest integration never selects streaming/full methods or splits sentences itself.
If `Speak()` returns `false`, integration calls `talkingHead:Hide()`, which also
clears the loading spinner, and preserves the failure return values.

The spinner turns on before speech submission. The shared `OutLoud.Narration`
controller supplies a session-end callback that hides Talking Head and clears
the spinner on completion,
stop, or failure. Each narration request gets a new presentation ownership token before speech
is submitted, so cancellation of the previous session cannot hide the new display.
The callback also handles completion during the native submission call. A
playback-start callback clears loading at the first valid current session
bookmark, once per session in both reading modes, and checks the same presentation
ownership token. The spinner stays on while speech is generating; submission
return and unowned playback-start events do not clear it. TTS does not depend on
the UI.
Closing or changing the quest window only updates button visibility; it neither
stops narration nor hides Talking Head. The Talking Head close button hides the
presentation and spinner, then calls `OutLoud.TTS:Stop()` to cancel narration.

### Automatic QuestFrame narration

`OutLoudDB.autoNarrateQuests` defaults to `false` when absent; existing saved
values and voice/reading-mode settings are preserved. Database access uses
`GetAutoNarrateQuests()` and `SetAutoNarrateQuests(enabled)`.

`OutLoudDB.autoNarrationDelay` stores seconds, defaulting to `2`. Database access
uses `GetAutoNarrationDelay()` and `SetAutoNarrationDelay(delay)`. Initialization
and the setter clamp numeric values to 0–5 and round to the nearest 0.5-second
step; invalid values use the default. Valid existing values are preserved.
`Database.AutoNarrationDelay` supplies the shared default, bounds, and step.

The Settings section is labelled **Narration**, with the existing **Reading Mode**
choices and **Automatically read quest text** checkbox. The checkbox uses
`SettingsCheckboxTemplate`, `SettingsCheckboxMixin:Init()`, and its
`OnValueChanged` callback from the local Forever export's
`Blizzard_Settings_Shared/Blizzard_SettingControls.xml` and `.lua`. Its tooltip
handlers and large hover highlight are disabled; interaction covers only the
checkbox and label. The visible description shares the existing description
font/wrapping and is included in the page's scroll height.

Below it, **Automatic narration delay** uses `MinimalSliderWithSteppersTemplate`
from `Blizzard_SharedXML/Shared/Slider/MinimalSlider.xml` and `.lua`, the same
control used by native Settings sliders. `Init(value, min, max, steps, formatters)`
receives 10 steps across 0–5 seconds. The right-label formatter displays values
such as `0 s`, `0.5 s`, and `2 s`; `OnValueChanged` saves changes. `SetEnabled()`
disables both the slider and its stepper buttons when automatic narration is off.
Checkbox changes and opening the controls refresh the saved value and enabled
state, with programmatic refreshes excluded from saving.

Only the existing `QuestFrame` `OnEvent` post-hook schedules automatic narration,
after Blizzard handles the event and Out Loud refreshes button visibility:

| Event | Current dialogue source |
| --- | --- |
| `QUEST_DETAIL` | `GetQuestText()` |
| `QUEST_PROGRESS` | `GetProgressText()` |
| `QUEST_COMPLETE` | `GetRewardText()` |

These events were verified in-game by the user. The local shared
`Mainline/QuestFrame.lua` registers them and shows their corresponding panels;
the panels' `OnShow` handlers hide the previous panels before the post-hook runs.
When enabled, the event hook calls `ScheduleAutoNarration(event)`. A zero delay
calls `StartCurrentNarration()` immediately; other values create one cancellable
`C_Timer.NewTimer()` in `QuestIntegration.PendingAutoNarration`. The request
captures `GetQuestID()`, the current text, and its source. Before reading, the
callback checks that this is still the pending request, automatic narration is
enabled, and the same quest/page/text is still available. It then calls the same
`StartCurrentNarration()` wrapper as the manual button, which invokes
`SpeakCurrentText()` with existing error handling, text validation, NPC-to-player
fallback, and shared narration lifecycle.

Replacing the automatic event, closing QuestFrame, changing the quest/page/text,
disabling automatic narration, or starting manual QuestFrame narration cancels
and clears the pending timer. Existing frame lifecycle hooks check context;
a post-hook on `Database:SetAutoNarrateQuests()` handles disabling the setting.
A post-hook on `TTS:StartSession()` also cancels pending automatic narration when
another narration session starts, including Quest Log or direct TTS calls.
Cancelled callbacks cannot revive an old request. There are no extra event
frames, polling, or show/hide narration triggers; the timer only schedules the
automatic path, without changing TTS generation or streaming.

The manual button's visibility and placement are independent of these settings.
Manual QuestFrame narration cancels any pending automatic request and starts
immediately. Quest Log retains its explicit-click path, never consults the delay,
and starts immediately.

Check the default-off state, slider layout and disabled state, 0.5-second steps,
seconds formatting, default delay and persistence after reload in-game. Verify
all three automatic page reads with zero and nonzero delays in both modes,
NPC/player fallback, cancellation on close/page change/disable/replacement, and
immediate manual QuestFrame and Quest Log reads without a later duplicate.
No automated tests were added or run for the automatic-delay integration.

### Quest Log player narration

`OutLoud.UI.QuestLogIntegration` uses the actual shared layout loaded for
Forever/Camelot by `Blizzard_UIPanels_Game.toc`: `Mainline/QuestMapFrame.xml`
and `.lua`, with `Camelot/QuestMapFrameOverrides.lua` and
`Camelot/QuestMapFrameUtils.lua`. These files are under
`DevResources/BlizzardInterfaceCode/Interface/AddOns/Blizzard_UIPanels_Game/`.
`Blizzard_WorldMap/QuestLogOwnerMixin.lua` supplies the parent map/log lifecycle.

The frame is `QuestMapFrame`, whose `DetailsFrame` aliases
`QuestMapFrame.QuestsFrame.DetailsFrame`. `DetailsFrame.BackFrame.BackButton`
is Blizzard's **Back** control. Out Loud creates a sibling button in `BackFrame`,
mirrors Back's left inset at the right edge, and uses the same vertical offset
and button size. The exported Back anchor is `LEFT`, inset 11, offset Y 4.
Neither the native button nor the quest description scroll child is modified.

Visibility requires the log and description detail viewport to be visible,
a positive selected quest ID matching `DetailsFrame.questID`, a valid log index,
and a nonempty description. `HookScript` follows the existing frame events and
show/hide handlers. Post-hooks on `QuestMapFrame_ShowQuestDetails` and
`QuestMapFrame_CloseQuestDetails` also cover quest switching and returning Back.
Initialization waits on `ADDON_LOADED` if the native UI has not loaded;
there is no polling or forced Blizzard addon loading.

Every click rereads `C_QuestLog.GetSelectedQuest()`, resolves its log index with
`C_QuestLog.GetLogIndexForQuestID()`, then obtains only the first return value of
`GetQuestLogQuestText(questIndex)`. Objectives are never submitted. It resolves
the player's configured voice with `VoiceSelection:ResolvePlayer()` and calls
`OutLoud.Narration:Speak("player", description, voiceID)`.

Explicit player token mappings are:

| Race token | Voice Family |
| --- | --- |
| `Human` | `HUMAN` |
| `Orc` | `ORC` |
| `Dwarf` | `DWARF` |
| `NightElf` | `NIGHT_ELF` |
| `Scourge` | `UNDEAD` |
| `Tauren` | `TAUREN` |
| `Gnome` | `GNOME` |
| `Troll` | `TROLL` |
| `BloodElf` | `BLOOD_ELF` |
| `Draenei` | `DRAENEI` |
| `Goblin` | `GOBLIN` |

No speculative Forever/custom race aliases, including a player token for
`SKYBORNE`, are added. Gender remains `UnitSex("player")`: 2 Male, 3 Female.

Both entry points share one presentation ownership token in `OutLoud.Narration`.
It forwards the existing end, playback-start, and text-progress callbacks from
`TTS:Speak()` to the same Talking Head. New narration replaces ownership before
TTS cancels the previous session, so a stale callback cannot hide the new speaker.
Both reading modes, loading, sentence fades, paged scrolling, and close/cancel
behavior remain in their existing services. Closing the Quest Log only hides
its button; narration can continue. No TTS/session/bookmark code was changed.

Button placement/visibility, player rendering and voice tokens, description-only
audio in both modes, and replacement between QuestFrame and Quest Log narration
require in-game verification. No new automated tests were added or run for this
integration; the existing QuestFrame test loader includes the extracted helper.

### Talking Head visual animations

`UI/TalkingHead.xml` defines an independent `OutLoudTalkingHeadTemplate`, using
the hierarchy, fonts, decorative atlases, and native animation definitions from
the local export at
`DevResources/BlizzardInterfaceCode/Interface/AddOns/Blizzard_FrameXML/TalkingHeadUI.xml`
and sequencing from the adjacent `TalkingHeadUI.lua`. Out Loud does not instantiate
Blizzard's live `TalkingHeadFrame` or attach its conversation/model mixins.
The root retains size 570 by 155, scale 1.05, and its bottom offset of 190.
Faction atlas selection and `PlayerModel:SetUnit(unit)` remain unchanged; name
colors, text styling, and internal text anchors follow the Blizzard reference.

The root stays at alpha 1. Animated regions reset to alpha 0.01, including the
portrait backdrop, which now belongs to the model as in Blizzard's hierarchy.
`Fadein` and `TalkingHeadsInAnim` use these timings in seconds:

| Element | Start delay | Fade duration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Portrait frame, model, model backdrop | 0 | 0.75 |
| Text background | 0.4 | 0.75 |
| Name | 0.5 | 0.25 |
| Dialogue text | 0.75 | 0.25 |
| Close button | 0.75 | 0.75 |

The name/text delays encode the offsets from Blizzard's `FadeinFrames()` timers
directly in animation groups, so stopping a group cancels pending fades too.
All animations use order 1 and retain Blizzard's `setToFinalAlpha` behavior.
Decorative alpha peaks at 0.7 and returns to 0:

- Top glow: starts at 0.15, fades in over 0.25 and out at 0.4 over 0.5;
  horizontal scale grows from 0.25 to 1.5 over 0.25.
- Side glows: start at 0.35, fade in over 0.25, translate down 10 units over
  0.8, and scale vertically from 0.5 to 1.6 over 0.7 with a top origin.
  Left fades out at 0.85 and right at 0.95, each over 0.25.
- Name sheen: starts at 0.5, fades in over 0.5 and out at 1 over 0.5;
  horizontal scale grows from 0.25 to 1 over 0.25 with a left origin.
- Text sheen: starts at 0.75, fades in over 0.5 and out at 1.25 over 0.5;
  the same scale animation lasts 0.25 with a left origin.

`Hide()` stops entrance effects and runs the five Blizzard-style `Close` groups,
which fade the model/backdrop, portrait, background, name, text, and close button
from 1 to 0 over one second. The main close group's completion hides the root.
Repeated Hide calls keep the running exit; Show stops all groups, resets alpha
and animation transforms, replaces the NPC/text, and starts a fresh entrance.
The template also retains the 0.25-second name/text `Fadeout` definitions, but
Out Loud does not perform Blizzard's automatic conversation-line transitions.
Conversation timers, sound playback, and model animation kits requiring
`C_TalkingHead` are deliberately excluded.

The spinner stays outside these animation groups and remains controlled by
`SetLoading()`. The close button still cancels speech immediately; animations
affect only presentation. In-game checks are required for native XML/template
loading, fonts/atlases, model/backdrop opacity, movement, and interrupted reuse.

### Speaker model idle pose

The shared Talking Head uses `PlayerModel:SetAnimation(0, 0)` after loading either
the NPC or player, and on playback finish/cancellation and close. Playback does
not start model gestures or animation timers. The randomized conversation
controller, its completion callbacks, and its state have been removed.
Blizzard-style frame animations, sentence transitions, scrolling, and loading
remain independent and unchanged. Verify the default idle pose on NPC/player
models in-game; no automated tests were added or run for this change.

### Playback-following text viewport

`TextFrame.Scroll` clips a scroll-child FontString inside the original dialogue
bounds, with the existing font and color and a narrow scrollbar gutter. The
Blizzard text-fit mixin is omitted here so overflow scrolls at the existing font
size instead of shrinking the text. The entrance/exit groups still animate only
their original targets; their dialogue target now resolves through
`Scroll.Content.Text`. The text sheen anchors to
the fixed viewport, so it does not move with the scroll content.

Full mode prepares all text before the entrance and never replaces it during
playback. Split mode prepares the first sentence using `TTS:SplitSentences()`.
Quest integration forwards the fifth TTS callback only while its existing
presentation ownership token is current. Sentence ownership notifications change
the display; prefetch submissions do not. Later changes use native `SentenceOut`
and `SentenceIn` alpha groups, each lasting 0.08 seconds. The new sentence replaces
the old text between them and resets scrolling. These groups do not animate the
portrait, name, background, close button, or spinner. A rapid new sentence replaces
the pending display rather than starting an obsolete transition.

The existing current-session ownership callback starts UI auto-scroll, once for
full text or for each active split sentence after its fade swaps the text.
`AUTO_SCROLL_SPEED = 6` in `UI/TalkingHead.lua` moves the text six pixels per
second with a native linear Translation animation. `OnUpdate` synchronizes the
scrollbar and native scroll offset to that animation only while scrolling is active.
The FontString anchor compensates for the native scroll offset during animation,
so text moves through the render transform instead of stepping with layout pixels.
Stopping commits the current fractional position back to normal scrolling. It
stops at the bottom or when playback ends, text changes, or Talking Head hides.
This fixed UI speed does not estimate audio duration or follow individual words;
no word-level or intra-sentence UI bookmarks are inserted into speech.

Blizzard's native `MinimalScrollBar` sits beside the clipped viewport, clear of
the close button and spinner, and hides when text fits. Its ends are inset from
the dialogue bounds and its native track has compact arrow gaps suitable for this
short viewport. Its visible extent and
scroll percentage follow the text layout and viewport position. Thumb dragging,
native scrollbar controls, and mouse-wheel input over the viewport pause auto-scroll
for the current text. A new narration or split sentence enables it again.
Programmatic scrollbar updates are guarded because native `SetScrollPercentage`
also emits `OnScroll`; they cannot be mistaken for manual input or recurse.
All scroll positions are clamped to the measured vertical overflow.

New narration and displayed sentences reset to the top. Finish stops text motion
and retains the final text at its current position during the existing closing
sequence.
Cancellation stops pending fades/motion and resets to the top. Hide stops updates
immediately, then resets the scroll position when the visual exit finishes;
Show during that exit cancels it and resets immediately. Existing quest integration
still closes Talking Head when narration ends. Loading and TTS cancellation are
unchanged. Scrollbar placement/dragging, scrolling speed, text clipping, sentence
transitions, and cancellation/reuse need visual in-game verification.

Missing text produces no new Talking Head presentation or speech. NPC resolution
failure uses the player's configured voice and `"player"` Talking Head model/name;
there is no generic default voice. If player resolution also fails, a red error
is shown and no new narration starts. The inspection model is cleared before
each NPC load to prevent reuse of the previous NPC's FileDataID. An asynchronous
load returning `model-unavailable` immediately takes the player fallback;
there is no model-loading retry timer or fallback loop. Normal NPC narration,
item/no-NPC quests, both reading modes, and failed player resolution require
in-game verification.

### Narration diagnostics

Normal narration is silent in chat. Failed reads, caught button errors, native
`SpeakText` errors, owned playback failures, and session-end callback errors use
`OutLoud:Error(...)` to print a red `[Out Loud]` message. Stopping or finishing
narration normally does not print an error. Unidentified playback failures do
not produce an error message because they may belong to unrelated TTS.

Enable detailed diagnostics for the current login with this Toolbox Console command:

```lua
OutLoud.DebugEnabled = true
```

These optional diagnostics include voice resolution, submission, bookmarks, and
session state. Set the flag to `false` to disable them. It is not saved; a UI
reload disables routine diagnostics again. Error messages remain enabled.

### Blizzard source reference and verification limits

Implementation was checked against the exported `forever` branch at commit
`15666a6e67938a1ab5caf041406464251db111ca`, labelled **1.60.1 (70245)**:

- [Vanilla QuestFrame.xml](https://github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-source/blob/15666a6e67938a1ab5caf041406464251db111ca/Interface/AddOns/Blizzard_UIPanels_Game/Vanilla/QuestFrame.xml)
  declares the four panels, native button template, and action-button anchors.
- [QuestFrame handlers in the export](https://github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-source/blob/15666a6e67938a1ab5caf041406464251db111ca/Interface/AddOns/Blizzard_UIPanels_Game/Mainline/QuestFrame.lua)
  show the event/panel transitions and `GetProgressText()` source.
- [Vanilla QuestInfo.lua](https://github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-source/blob/15666a6e67938a1ab5caf041406464251db111ca/Interface/AddOns/Blizzard_UIPanels_Game/Vanilla/QuestInfo.lua)
  uses `GetQuestText()` for live dialogue and `GetRewardText()` for rewards.
- [SimpleModel API export](https://github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-source/blob/15666a6e67938a1ab5caf041406464251db111ca/Interface/AddOns/Blizzard_APIDocumentationGenerated/SimpleModelAPIDocumentation.lua)
  includes `ClearModel()` and `GetModelFileID()`.

The user subsequently verified all three text sources directly in WoW: Forever:
`GetQuestText()` returned the visible offer dialogue for Shadow Priest Sarvis;
`GetProgressText()` and `GetRewardText()` returned the visible progress and final
reward dialogue. The existing resolver was also verified for Junior Apothecary
Holland: model `959310`, family `UNDEAD`, `UnitSex = 2`, configured voice `1`.
These user-reported checks establish the API choices, not the full integration.

The source export remains the reference for frame names and hooks. The export's
game/family file selection, actual panel/event behavior, template layout,
immediate reusable PlayerModel readiness, Talking Head portrait/name/text rendering,
spinner behavior, and actual audio in the combined click flow still require
verification in WoW: Forever. No in-game execution was performed by the agent.

### In-game QuestFrame checklist

Configure the NPC's Voice Family and runtime gender voice first, then:

1. Open an NPC quest greeting/list: button hidden.
2. Select a quest offer/detail: button visible without overlapping native controls.
3. Click Out Loud: current offer dialogue uses the configured NPC voice and chosen
   reading mode. Talking Head shows the NPC portrait/name and exact
   `GetQuestText()` result, with loading on before submission. Click again to
   check presentation update and narration restart.
4. Return to an incomplete/in-progress quest with dialogue: button visible;
   clicking displays and narrates the exact `GetProgressText()` result.
5. Turn in a completed quest: button visible for concrete progress/turn-in text.
6. Advance to completion/reward: button visible; clicking displays and narrates
   the exact `GetRewardText()` result.
7. Close QuestFrame: button disappears.
8. Return to greeting/list: button hidden again.

Repeat the three dialogue-page click checks in both **Split text** and
**Read full text** Options modes. The configured voice and full Talking Head text
should stay the same while the TTS submission mode changes. Talking Head closes
and clears its spinner after the full text or final streamed sentence finishes.
Click again during narration to check that restarting keeps the new presentation
visible. Closing Talking Head stops narration; calling `OutLoud.TTS:Stop()` also
closes the presentation. With an unset NPC voice or an unavailable/unmapped model,
clicking should use the configured player voice and player portrait/name for the
same dialogue. Check an item quest with no `questnpc` as well. If player resolution
also fails, no new presentation or speech should start and a red error should
explain the failure.

### Inspect the current quest NPC

With a quest dialog open, run this Lua command in Toolbox Console. It uses a
separate model and prints once after a short loading delay. If the reason is
`model-unavailable`, rerun after the model loads. The delay belongs only to this
inspection command, not the speech controller.

```lua
local model = CreateFrame("PlayerModel")
model:SetUnit("questnpc")
C_Timer.After(0.5, function()
    local voice, info = OutLoud.VoiceSelection:Resolve("questnpc", model)
    print("NPC:", tostring(info.name), "ModelFileID:", tostring(info.modelFileID),
